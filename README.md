# Beyond "Hello World!" - Python for advanced beginners
Introducing some of the advanced concepts that can help you write better, Pythonic code.

## Session description
In this session, we go beyond the basics of Python. We discuss some concepts that are very important to
writing idiomatic Python and to better understand third party code.

Participants will learn about advanced data structures in Python like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, learn how to effectively use comprehensions, and how to apply some basic functional programming techniques using `map` and `filter`.

## Getting started

### Requirements
You should have basic experience with Python and now about basic types, how to write and call a function, and how to write a basic for loop.

### Usage
The repo has the following structure:
