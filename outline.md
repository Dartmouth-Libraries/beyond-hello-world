For a 60-minute training session targeting advanced beginners in Python, who are already familiar with basic types, flow control, and some object-oriented programming (OOP), you'll want to focus on topics that build upon these foundations. The goal is to introduce more complex concepts and tools that will be broadly useful in many Python projects. Here's a suggested outline:

### 1. **Advanced Data Structures** (15 minutes)
- **Dictionaries**: Beyond the basics, cover dictionary comprehensions, iterating over keys and values, and using `get()` and `setdefault()`.
- **Sets**: Introduction to sets, set operations (union, intersection, difference), and when to use a set over a list.
- **Tuples**: Immutable sequences, tuple unpacking, and using tuples as keys in dictionaries.

### 2. **List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions** (10 minutes)
- Syntax and examples of list comprehensions, including conditional expressions.
- Introduction to generator expressions for creating iterators on-the-fly with lower memory usage.

### 3. **Functions and Functional Programming Concepts** (15 minutes)
- **First-class functions**: Passing functions as arguments, returning functions from functions.
- **Lambdas**: When and how to use anonymous functions.
- **Map, Filter, Reduce**: Using these functions with lambdas to process collections in a functional style.

### 4. **Modules and Packages** (10 minutes)
- Understanding Python modules and how to import them.
- An overview of packages, and using `pip` to install third-party packages.
- A quick guide on creating your own modules and packages for larger projects.

### 5. **Exception Handling and Debugging** (10 minutes)
- Basics of try-except-else-finally blocks.
- Raising exceptions with `raise`.
- Tips for debugging in Python, including using the `pdb` module for stepping through code.

### Wrapping up and Q&A (10 minutes)
- Recap of the key points.
- Open the floor for questions and provide additional resources for further learning.

This session plan aims to cover a range of topics that are immediately useful and can significantly enhance the learners' programming skills in Python. Ensure that each section includes both explanations and practical examples or short exercises to keep the session interactive and reinforce learning.
